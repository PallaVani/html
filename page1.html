The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest 
particles of debris – in its orbit.
The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons,ocean currents,weather,climate,radiation belts and auroras.
There are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.
The Sun has many names in many cultures. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective
for all things Sun-related: solar.
</b>
</p>
<ul>  
    <li>Just like most other stars, the sun is made up mostly of hydrogen, followed by helium.
        Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon.</li>
    <li>For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen,
        40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon.</li>
    <li><em>Sunspots:</em> are relatively cool, dark features on the sun's surface that are often roughly circular. 
        They emerge where dense bundles of magnetic field lines from the sun's interior break through the surface.</li>

       <p>Mercury is a rocky planet and chemical element:
        <i>Planet:</i>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a radius of 2,439.7 kilometers and a circumference of about 9,500 miles. 
        It's smaller than Earth's core but larger than the moon. Mercury is made up of 70% metallic and 30% silicate material, and has a 
        solid surface covered in craters that resembles the moon. It's the closest planet to the sun, orbiting at an average distance of 
        36 million miles and traveling at about 29 miles per second. Mercury has a thin exosphere and no atmosphere to retain heat at night, 
        so its surface temperatures can range from 800°F during the day to -290°F at night. A day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days, 
        and a year lasts 88 Earth days.</p><br>

       <img src="/images/VENUS.jpg" alt="venus" height="666" width="1000">
       <p>Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin.
          Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.
          Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, even hotter than the dayside of Mercury, which has temperatures of 801 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius).
          Because of Venus' thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, the heat is efficiently retained, creating surface temperatures higher than 880 degrees F (470 degrees C).

       <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest planet in our solar system. It has a radius of 3,959 miles and a diameter of 7,917.5 miles. 
          Earth is 93 million miles away from the sun and orbits it once every 365.25 days.Earth is the only planet in our solar system known to support life.
          It's made up of rock and metals, and its surface is covered by mountains, valleys, volcanoes, and oceans.About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water,
          which is why it's called the blue planet from outer space. Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and argon.
          Conditions favourable to support life are probably found only on the earth. The earth is neither too hotnor too cold. It has water and air, which are very
          essential for our survival. The air has life-supporting gases like oxygen. Because of these reasons, the earth is a unique planet in the solar system.
          From the outer space, the earth appears blue because its two-thirds surface is covered by water. It is, therefore, called a blue planet.

       <img src="/images/Jupiter.avif" alt="Jupiter" height="666" width="1000">
       <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System 
          combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest
          natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times.Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, 
          the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610:
          Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.
          Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.</p><br>

       <p><em>Saturn</em> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.
          It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.Even though Saturn is nearly the size of Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass.
          Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 years.Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer
          of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.
          An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that
          of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived
          features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).</p><br>

       <img src="/images/uranus.png" alt="Uranus" height="666" width="1000">
       <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy
         is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all the Solar System's planets.
         It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years 
         of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside
         its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide 
         along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its
         peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),</p><br>

          It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
          compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1
          astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). </p><br>

       <img src="/images/pluto.jpg" alt="Pluto" height="666" width="1000">
       <p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun.
         It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets.
         Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one-third its volume.Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. 
         Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
         Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body,
         and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements and observations.</p><br>
